  # 031: want to include alias of any table names which this rule didn't allow
  # 044: took out because wouldn't allow `*`
  # 009: trailing whitespace conflicts with the precommit that removes it
  # 034: want to allow for control of order of columns rather than sqlfluff to reorder
  # 035: rule: Do not specify "else null" in a case when statement.  Removed to make the case statement more explicit
  # 042: allow for subqueries
